# Convolutional-NN---NN2

The goal of the project is to work with a simple neural network to classify between birds and cats from the 
dataset CIFAR10 and from it, learn about its confidentiality when predicting labels and some techniques to 
improve it. All this will be performed with the help of the text "On calibration on modern neural networks" 
which goes deeply into the importance of network confidentiality offering examples to improve it. 

For classification techniques, lots of new models, neural networks and so on have been created with the aim of 
obtaining the highest possible accuracy when predicting values. But this should not be the only goal. As 
mentioned in the paper: “In real-world decision-making systems, classification networks must not only be 
accurate but also should indicate when they are likely to be incorrect”. Each classification problem is a whole 
new world and can be used for many different purposes, but most of them, especially those related to important 
decisions such as human health, should be 100% sure that their answer is correct.
